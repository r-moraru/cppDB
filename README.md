# cppDB
## A database management system with a simple UI.
New features:
* **Import and export table contents** using .csv files
* **Index tables** by adding a primary key to a table

The program provides three tabs:
* A database list page, where users can select or delete an existing database, or create a new one
* A table list page, showing tables from a selected database. Here, tables can be created either manually or by importing a .csv file.
* A table query page. Table contents can be viewed by using the "View Table Data" or "Select" commands. 
Entries can be added, updated or deleted from this page. Multiple rows can be added at once through .csv files.
